    <h1>CSS Introduction</h1>

    <h4>Styles Solved a Big problem</h4>

    <p>
      HTML was never intended to contain tags for formatting a document.<br />
      HTML was intended to define the content of a document, like: headings and paragraphs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Styling started to make a mess in html documents making them almost unlegible. So CSS style sheets were invented.
    </p>

    <h4>External style sheets are usually kept in a .css file</h4>
