    <h1>CSS Syntax</h1>

    <h4>A css rule has two parts a selector and at least one declaration</h4>

    example: h1: {color:blue; font-size:12px;}

    <h4>Each declaration consists of a property and a value</h4>

    To make it more readable you may put each declaration on its own line.

    <p>
      p<br />
      {<br />
        color:red;<br />
        text-align:center;<br />
      }
    </p>

    <h4>CSS Comments</h4>

    <p>
